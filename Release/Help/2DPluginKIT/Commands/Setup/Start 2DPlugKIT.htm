  </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE=Verdana SIZE=2>this command will return a value 
  of 1 if 2DPlugKIT was correctly initialized.<br>
  You must enter your username and usercode provided with your 2DPlugKIT registration 
  to initialize the plugin system<br>
  If you want you can choose a mode. 3 modes are available and work differently:<br>
  <br>
  Mode = 0<br>
  This mode will use the original images you defined for tiles. That mean that 
  each tile can have a different size, but don't forget that for optimal results, 
  all tiles from the same layer must have the same size. Pixels collisions can 
  only be calculated if you RESERVE TILES / PREPARE TILES on tiles with the same 
  size than the default tiles sizes. (=default mode)<br>
  Mode = 1<br>
  This mode force the plugin to use DarkBASIC Professional sprites for all rendering. 
  It's a bit faster than mode 0 but, in that mode all tiles must have the same 
  size even if they're on the same layer or not.<br>
  Mode = 2<br>
  This mode is a special mode and requires an external plugin to work. This plugin 
  is called &quot;Advanced SPRITES&quot; and isn't provided in the 2DPlugKIT package. This 
  plugin allow DarkBASIC Professional to user fast sprite rendering. With this 
  plugin you can expect a speed increase from 200% up to 600%. Plugin will be 
  available separately from 2DPlugKIT<br>
